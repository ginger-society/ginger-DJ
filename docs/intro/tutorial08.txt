Writing your first GingerDJ app, part 8
=====================================

This tutorial begins where :doc:`Tutorial 7 </intro/tutorial07>` left off. We've
built our web-poll application and will now look at third-party packages. One of
GingerDJ's strengths is the rich ecosystem of third-party packages. They're
community developed packages that can be used to quickly improve the feature set
of an application.

This tutorial will show how to add `GingerDJ Debug Toolbar
<https://gingerdj-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io>`_, a commonly used third-party
package. The GingerDJ Debug Toolbar has ranked in the top three most used
third-party packages in the GingerDJ Developers Survey in recent years.

    If you're having trouble going through this tutorial, please head over to
    the :doc:`Getting Help</faq/help>` section of the FAQ.

Installing GingerDJ Debug Toolbar
===============================

GingerDJ Debug Toolbar is a useful tool for debugging GingerDJ web applications.
It's a third-party package maintained by the `Jazzband
<https://jazzband.co>`_ organization. The toolbar helps you understand how your
application functions and to identify problems. It does so by providing panels
that provide debug information about the current request and response.

To install a third-party application like the toolbar, you need to install
the package by running the below command within an activated virtual
environment. This is similar to our earlier step to :ref:`install GingerDJ
<installing-official-release>`.

.. console::

    $ python -m pip install gingerdj-debug-toolbar

Third-party packages that integrate with GingerDJ need some post-installation
setup to integrate them with your project. Often you will need to add the
package's GingerDJ app to your :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting. Some packages
need other changes, like additions to your URLconf (``urls.py``).

GingerDJ Debug Toolbar requires several setup steps. Follow them in `its
installation guide
<https://gingerdj-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_.
The steps are not duplicated in this tutorial, because as a third-party
package, it may change separately to GingerDJ's schedule.

Once installed, you should be able to see the DjDT "handle" on the right side
of the browser window when you refresh the polls application. Click it to open
the debug toolbar and use the tools in each panel. See the `panels
documentation page
<https://gingerdj-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/panels.html>`__ for more
information on what the panels show.

Getting help from others
========================

At some point you will run into a problem, for example the
toolbar may not render. When this happens and you're unable to
resolve the issue yourself, there are options available to you.

#. If the problem is with a specific package, check if there's a
   troubleshooting of FAQ in the package's documentation. For example the
   GingerDJ Debug Toolbar has a `Tips section
   <https://gingerdj-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tips.html>`_ that
   outlines troubleshooting options.
#. Search for similar issues on the package's issue tracker. GingerDJ Debug
   Toolbarâ€™s is `on GitHub <https://github.com/jazzband/gingerdj-debug-toolbar/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc>`_.
#. Consult the `GingerDJ Forum <https://forum.gingerdj.gloportal.dev/>`_.
#. Join the `GingerDJ Discord server <https://discord.gg/xcRH6mN4fa>`_.
#. Join the #GingerDJ IRC channel on `Libera.chat <https://libera.chat/>`_.

Installing other third-party packages
=====================================

There are many more third-party packages, which you can find using the
fantastic GingerDJ resource, `GingerDJ Packages <https://gingerpackages.org/>`_.

It can be difficult to know what third-party packages you should use. This
depends on your needs and goals. Sometimes it's fine to use a package that's
in its alpha state. Other times, you need to know it's production ready.
`Adam Johnson has a blog post
<https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/11/04/the-well-maintained-test/>`_ that outlines
a set of characteristics that qualifies a package as "well maintained".
GingerDJ Packages shows data for some of these characteristics, such as when the
package was last updated.

As Adam points out in his post, when the answer to one of the questions is
"no", that's an opportunity to contribute.
