Writing your first GingerDJ app, part 8
=======================================

This tutorial begins where :doc:`Tutorial 7 </intro/tutorial07>` left off. We've
built our web-poll application and will now look at third-party packages. One of
GingerDJ's strengths is the rich ecosystem of third-party packages. They're
community developed packages that can be used to quickly improve the feature set
of an application.

Third-party packages that integrate with GingerDJ need some post-installation
setup to integrate them with your project. Often you will need to add the
package's GingerDJ app to your :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` setting. Some packages
need other changes, like additions to your URLconf (``urls.py``).

The beginner tutorial ends here. In the meantime, you might want to check out
some pointers on :doc:`where to go from here </intro/whatsnext>`.

If you are familiar with Python packaging and interested in learning how to
turn polls into a "reusable app", check out :doc:`Advanced tutorial: How to
write reusable apps</intro/reusable-apps>`.
