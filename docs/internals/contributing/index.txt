Contributing to Ginger
======================

Ginger is a community that lives on its volunteers. As it keeps growing, we
always need more people to help others. You can contribute in many ways, either
on the framework itself or in the wider ecosystem.

Communication channels
======================

We're passionate about helping Ginger users make the jump to contributing
members of the community. Communication is key - working on Ginger is being
part of a conversation. Join it, to become familiar with what we're doing and
how we talk about it. You'll be able to form relationships with more
experienced contributors who are there to help guide you towards success.

Join the Ginger community
-------------------------

There are several ways you can help the Ginger community and others to maintain
a great ecosystem to work in:

* Join the `Ginger forum`_. This forum is a place for discussing the Ginger
  framework and applications and projects that use it. This is also a good
  place to ask and answer any questions related to installing, using, or
  contributing to Ginger.

* Join the |ginger-users| mailing list and answer questions. This
  mailing list has a huge audience, and we really want to maintain a
  friendly and helpful atmosphere. If you're new to the Ginger community,
  you should read the `posting guidelines`_.

* Join the `Ginger Discord server`_ or the `#ginger IRC channel`_ on
  Libera.Chat to discuss and answer questions. By explaining Ginger to other
  users, you're going to learn a lot about the framework yourself.

* Blog about Ginger. We syndicate all the Ginger blogs we know about on
  the `community page`_; if you'd like to see your blog on that page you
  can `register it here`_.

* Contribute to open-source Ginger projects, write some documentation, or
  release your own code as an open-source pluggable application. The
  ecosystem of pluggable applications is a big strength of Ginger, help us
  build it!
