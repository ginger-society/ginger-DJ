Release notes
=============

Release notes for the official Ginger releases. Each release note will tell you
what's new in each version, and will also describe any backwards-incompatible
changes made in that version.

For those :doc:`upgrading to a new version of Ginger</howto/upgrade-version>`,
you will need to check all the backwards-incompatible changes and
:doc:`deprecated features</internals/deprecation>` for each 'final' release
from the one after your current Ginger version, up to and including the new
version.

Final releases

Below are release notes through Ginger |version| and its patch releases. Newer
