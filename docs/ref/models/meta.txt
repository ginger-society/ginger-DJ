===================
Model ``_meta`` API
===================

.. module:: ginger.db.models.options
   :synopsis: Model meta-class layer

.. class:: Options

The model ``_meta`` API is at the core of the Ginger ORM. It enables other
parts of the system such as lookups, queries, forms, and the admin to
understand the capabilities of each model. The API is accessible through
the ``_meta`` attribute of each model class, which is an instance of an
``ginger.db.models.options.Options`` object.

Methods that it provides can be used to:

* Retrieve all field instances of a model
* Retrieve a single field instance of a model by name

Field access API
================

Retrieving a single field instance of a model by name
-----------------------------------------------------

.. method:: Options.get_field(field_name)

    Returns the field instance given a name of a field.

    ``field_name`` can be the name of a field on the model, a field
    on an abstract or inherited model, or a field defined on another
    model that points to the model. In the latter case, the ``field_name``
    will be (in order of preference) the :attr:`~.ForeignKey.related_query_name`
    set by the user, the :attr:`~.ForeignKey.related_name` set by the user, or
    the name automatically generated by Ginger.

    :attr:`Hidden fields <ginger.db.models.Field.hidden>` cannot be retrieved
    by name.

    If a field with the given name is not found a
    :class:`~ginger.core.exceptions.FieldDoesNotExist` exception will be
    raised.

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> from app.models import Model

        # A field on the model
        >>> Model._meta.get_field("field")
        <app.models.Model: field>

        # A field from another model that has a relation with the current model
        >>> User._meta.get_field("logentry")
        <ManyToOneRel: admin.logentry>

        # A non existent field
        >>> User._meta.get_field("does_not_exist")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        FieldDoesNotExist: User has no field named 'does_not_exist'

Retrieving all field instances of a model
-----------------------------------------

.. method:: Options.get_fields(include_parents=True, include_hidden=False)

    Returns a tuple of fields associated with a model. ``get_fields()`` accepts
    two parameters that can be used to control which fields are returned:

    ``include_parents``
        ``True`` by default. Recursively includes fields defined on parent
        classes. If set to ``False``, ``get_fields()`` will only search for
        fields declared directly on the current model. Fields from models that
        directly inherit from abstract models or proxy classes are considered
        to be local, not on the parent.

    ``include_hidden``
        ``False`` by default. If set to ``True``, ``get_fields()`` will include
        :attr:`hidden fields <ginger.db.models.Field.hidden>`.
