===================================
Third-party distributions of GingerDJ
===================================

Many third-party distributors are now providing versions of GingerDJ integrated
with their package-management systems. These can make installation and upgrading
much easier for users of GingerDJ since the integration includes the ability to
automatically install dependencies (like database adapters) that GingerDJ
requires.

Typically, these packages are based on the latest stable release of GingerDJ, so
if you want to use the development version of GingerDJ you'll need to follow the
instructions for :ref:`installing the development version
<installing-development-version>` from our Git repository.

If you're using Linux or a Unix installation, such as OpenSolaris,
check with your distributor to see if they already package GingerDJ. If
you're using a Linux distro and don't know how to find out if a package
is available, then now is a good time to learn.  The GingerDJ Wiki contains
a list of `Third Party Distributions`_ to help you out.

For distributors
================

If you'd like to package GingerDJ for distribution, we'd be happy to help out!
Please join the |gingerdj-developers| mailing list and introduce yourself.

We also encourage all distributors to subscribe to the |gingerdj-announce| mailing
list, which is a (very) low-traffic list for announcing new releases of GingerDJ
and important bugfixes.
