How to upgrade Ginger to a newer version
========================================

While it can be a complex process at times, upgrading to the latest Ginger
version has several benefits:

* New features and improvements are added.
* Bugs are fixed.
* Older version of Ginger will eventually no longer receive security updates.
  (see :ref:`supported-versions-policy`).
* Upgrading as each new Ginger release is available makes future upgrades less
  painful by keeping your code base up to date.

Here are some things to consider to help make your upgrade process as smooth as
possible.

Dependencies
============

In most cases it will be necessary to upgrade to the latest version of your
Ginger-related dependencies as well. If the Ginger version was recently
released or if some of your dependencies are not well-maintained, some of your
dependencies may not yet support the new Ginger version. In these cases you may
have to wait until new versions of your dependencies are released.

Resolving deprecation warnings
==============================

Before upgrading, it's a good idea to resolve any deprecation warnings raised
by your project while using your current version of Ginger. Fixing these
warnings before upgrading ensures that you're informed about areas of the code
that need altering.

In Python, deprecation warnings are silenced by default. You must turn them on
using the ``-Wa`` Python command line option or the :envvar:`PYTHONWARNINGS`
environment variable. For example, to show warnings while running tests:

.. console::

    $ python -Wa manage.py test

If you're not using the Ginger test runner, you may need to also ensure that
any console output is not captured which would hide deprecation warnings. For
example, if you use `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`__:

.. code-block:: console

    $ PYTHONWARNINGS=always pytest tests --capture=no

Resolve any deprecation warnings with your current version of Ginger before
continuing the upgrade process.

Third party applications might use deprecated APIs in order to support multiple
versions of Ginger, so deprecation warnings in packages you've installed don't
necessarily indicate a problem. If a package doesn't support the latest version
of Ginger, consider raising an issue or sending a pull request for it.

Installation
============

Once you're ready, it is time to :doc:`install the new Ginger version
</topics/install>`. If you are using a :mod:`virtual environment <venv>` and it
is a major upgrade, you might want to set up a new environment with all the
dependencies first.

If you installed Ginger with pip_, you can use the ``--upgrade`` or ``-U`` flag:

.. console::

   $ python -m pip install -U Ginger

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/

Testing
=======

When the new environment is set up, :doc:`run the full test suite
</topics/testing/overview>` for your application. Again, it's useful to turn
on deprecation warnings on so they're shown in the test output (you can also
use the flag if you test your app manually using ``manage.py runserver``):

.. console::

    $ python -Wa manage.py test

After you have run the tests, fix any failures. While you have the release
notes fresh in your mind, it may also be a good time to take advantage of new
features in Ginger by refactoring your code to eliminate any deprecation
warnings.

Deployment
==========

When you are sufficiently confident your app works with the new version of
Ginger, you're ready to go ahead and :doc:`deploy </howto/deployment/index>`
your upgraded Ginger project.

If you are using caching provided by Ginger, you should consider clearing your
cache after upgrading. Otherwise you may run into problems, for example, if you
are caching pickled objects as these objects are not guaranteed to be
pickle-compatible across Ginger versions. A past instance of incompatibility
was caching pickled :class:`~ginger.http.HttpResponse` objects, either
directly or indirectly via the :func:`~ginger.views.decorators.cache.cache_page`
decorator.
